# Data Science by Example

This repository is just a collection of examples using different libraries and tools for data analysis. As such, it is meant to be an every-growing, every-changing thing.

 * [1. The Philosophy of Wikipedia](examples/1_philosphy_of_wikipedia/RESULTS.md)
  * **Description**: Randal Monroe, of XKCD, posited the theory that if you start at *any* Wikipedia article and take the first link,then take the first link on that article, etcetera, you will eventually end up on the Philosophy page. Let's try it.
  * **Libraries**: iPython, BeautifulSoup, requests
  * **Concepts**: web scraping
 * [2. Parsing IMDB for the Best Writers & Directors](examples/2_imdb_writers_directors/RESULTS.md)
  * **Description**: Everyone knows their favorite actors. But only movie buffs know who their favorite directors are. And no one seems to know their favorite movie writers. IMDB has a wealth of information, let's dig through.
  * **Libraries**: iPython, Pandas
  * **Concepts**: web scraping, data analysis
 * [3. Parsing GoodReads for the Discworld Series](examples/3_discworld_on_goodreads/RESULTS.md)
  * **Description**: The Discworld series is one of the longest series of books ever written, with 41 books. If you haven't read anything in Discworld before, where should you start? Let's parse Goodreads (a book review website) to learn more.
  * **Libraries**: iPython,requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas
  * **Concepts**: web scraping, data analysis
 * [4. Classifying Irises](examples/4_classifying_irisses/RESULTS.md)
  * **Description**: Let's use a sample `scikit-learn` data set to learn about stochiast gradient descent classification.
  * **Libraries**: iPython, scikit-learn
  * **Concepts**: machine learning, SGD, classification
 * [5. Finding Outliers](examples/5_outliers/RESULTS.md)
  * **Description**: We've all seen bad data points that we had to remove. But how can we automate the process of finding bad data points? In this example, we'll implement the generalized Extreme Studentized Deviant (ESD) Test to solve the problem.
  * **Libraries**: iPython, scipy, matplotlib
  * **Concepts**: data analysis, outlier identification, ESD Testing
 * [6. Reading CSVs Fast](examples/6_reading_csv/RESULTS.md)
  * **Description**: Reading a CSV file line-by-line is an extremely common problem, one with a huge number of solutions. But which solution is fastest?
  * **Libraries**: numpy, re, pandas, io
  * **Concepts**: file-parsing, line-by-line reading
