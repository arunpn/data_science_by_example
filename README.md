# Data Science by Example

This repository is just a collection of examples using different libraries and tools for data analysis. As such, it is meant to be an every-growing, every-changing thing.

 * [1. The Philosophy of Wikipedia](examples/1_philosphy_of_wikipedia/RESULTS.md) - **iPython, BeautifulSoup, requests**
  * Randal Monroe, from XKCD, posited the theory that if you start on *any* page on Wikipedia and take the first link, you will eventually end up on the Philosophy page. Let's try it.
 * [2. Parsing IMDB for the Best Writers & Directors](examples/2_imdb_writers_directors/RESULTS.md) - **iPython, Pandas**
  * Everyone knows their favorite actors. But only movie buffs know who their favorite directors are. And no one seems to talk about their favorite movie writers. IMDB has a wealth of information available for download, let's take a look.
 * [3. Parsing GoodReads for the Discworld Series](examples/3_discworld_on_goodreads/RESULTS.md) - **iPython,requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas**
  * The Discworld series is one of the longest series of books ever written, with 41 books. If you haven't read anything in Discworld before, where should you start?
 * [4. Classifying Irises](examples/4_classifying_irisses/RESULTS.md) - **iPython, scikit-learn**
  * Let's use a sample `scikit-learn` data set to learn about stochiast gradient descent classification.
 * [5. Finding Outliers](examples/5_outliers/RESULTS.md) -- **iPython, scipy, matplotlib**
  * We've all seen bad data points in data that we wanted to remove. But how can we automate the process of finding bad data points? In this example, we'll implement the generalized Extreme Studentized Deviant (ESD) Test to solve the problem.
