# Data Science by Example

This repository is just a collection of examples using different libraries and tools for data analysis. As such, it is meant to be an every-growing, every-changing thing.

 * [1. The Philosophy of Wikipedia](examples/1_philosphy_of_wikipedia/RESULTS.md)
  * **Description**: Randal Monroe posited that if you start on any Wikipedia article and take the first link, then take the first link on that article, and repeat, you always end up on the Philosophy page. Let's try it.
  * **Libraries**: iPython, BeautifulSoup, requests
  * **Concepts**: web scraping
 * [2. Parsing IMDB for the Best Writers & Directors](examples/2_imdb_writers_directors/RESULTS.md)
