# Data Science by Example

This repository is just a collection of examples using different libraries and tools for data analysis. As such, it is meant to be an every-growing, every-changing thing.

 * [1. The Philosophy of Wikipedia](examples/1_philosphy_of_wikipedia/RESULTS.md) - **Python, iPython, BeautifulSoup, requests**
  * Randal Monroe, from XKCD, posited the theory that if you start on *any* page on Wikipedia and take the first link, you will eventually end up on the Philosophy page. Let's try it.
 * [2. Parsing IMDB for the Best Writers & Directors](examples/2_imdb_writers_directors/RESULTS.md) - **Python, iPython, Pandas**
  * Everyone knows their favorite actors. But only movie buffs know who their favorite directors are. And no one seems to talk about their favorite movie writers. IMDB has a wealth of information available for download, let's take a look.
 * [3. Parsing GoodReads for the Discworld Series](examples/3_discworld_on_goodreads/RESULTS.md) - **Python, iPython, BeautifulSoup, Pandas**
  * Terry Pratchett's Discworld book series ended up with a massive 41 books. But which books are the most popular, which are the best reviewed? Where should you start? Luckily, we can scrape a lot of great information from the GoodReads website and learn a lot about this website with no trouble.
