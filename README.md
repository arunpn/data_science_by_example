# Data Science by Example

This repository is just a collection of examples using different libraries and tools for data analysis. As such, it is meant to be an every-growing, every-changing thing.

 * [1. The Philosophy of Wikipedia](examples/1_philosphy_of_wikipedia/RESULTS.md)
  * Randal Monroe posited that if you start on any Wikipedia article and take the first link, then take the first link on that article, and repeat, you always end up on the Philosophy page. Let's try it.
    * **Tools**: iPython, BeautifulSoup, requests
    * **Concepts**: web scraping
 * [2. Parsing IMDB for the Best Writers & Directors](examples/2_imdb_writers_directors/RESULTS.md)
  * Everyone knows their favorite actors. But only movie buffs know their favorite directors. And no one seems to know their favorite movie writers. Let's use IMDB to find out more.
    * **Tools**: iPython, Pandas
    * **Concepts**: web scraping, data analysis
 * [3. Parsing GoodReads for the Discworld Series](examples/3_discworld_on_goodreads/RESULTS.md)
  * The Discworld is one of the longest series of books ever, with 41 books. If you haven't read anything in Discworld, where should you start? Let's scrape Goodreads to learn more.
    * **Tools**: iPython,requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas
    * **Concepts**: web scraping, data analysis
 * [4. Classifying Irises](examples/4_classifying_irisses/RESULTS.md)
  * Learning about supervised and unsupervised classification with `scikit-learn`.
    * **Tools**: iPython, scikit-learn
    * **Concepts**: machine learning, SGD, classification
 * [5. Finding Outliers](examples/5_outliers/RESULTS.md)
  * We'll implement the generalized ESD test to automate the task of finding bad data points.
    * **Tools**: iPython, scipy, matplotlib
    * **Concepts**: data analysis, outlier identification, ESD Testing
 * [6. Reading CSVs Fast](examples/6_reading_csv/RESULTS.md)
  * Reading a CSV file line-by-line is a common problem, with a lot of solutions. Which is fastest?
    * **Tools**: numpy, re, pandas, io
    * **Concepts**: file-parsing, line-by-line reading
