# Parsing IMDB for Writers & Directors

Everyone seems to know who their favorite actors are, I know I do. But it occurred to me that I don't know who my favorite writer and directors are.

I figured I could use IMDB to cross reference my favorite movies with the writers and directors responsible. As it happens, I have given a 1-through-10 rating to 700 movies on IMDB over the years. So I have some data to work with.
