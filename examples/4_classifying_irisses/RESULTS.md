# Classifying Irisses

This is a classic [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) example. Our goal is to identify what species an iris is, based on a couple of small measurements of an individual flower. We will do this using [Stochastic gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent).
