# 1. Philosophy of Wikipedia

Randal Monroe, of XKCD, [posited the theory](https://xkcd.com/903/) that if you start on any Wikipedia page and click the first link, you will eventually end up on the Philosophy page. I can not firmly attribute this idea to him, XKCD is just the first place I ran into it.

But I thought it would be a fun theory to test.
