# Parsing Goodreadsfor Information on the Discworld Series

In case you aren't already familiar with it, [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) does for books what [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) does for movies. It's a great site, with a lot of information to dig through.

This is a basic example of website parsing to get your data. To make it interesting, I choose the Discworld series of books. It is one of the longest series of books ever written, with over 40 books written over 30 years. This also gives us the opportunity to try out data plotting.
